There is no safe level of lead in the blood. Lead poisoning is particularly harmful to young children and pregnant women, as it can cause damage to the nervous system and developmental delays. In order to gain insight into this public health issue, we will analyze data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and from state and local health organizations.

In this project, we limit our scope to lead poisoning in the Midwestern United States. We seek to examine relationships between rates of elevated blood lead levels and other factors, including average income level, poverty rates, and rates of mental health issues, among others.
